#/// Purpose of code is to connect to sql database on remote host to retrieve data for analysis
#/// you can form you own connectors, but since I tend to do this regularly 
#/// why not share it

# import packages so we can instantiate them for use.

import pypyodbc 
import pandas as pd

# then instantiate our connector to a local db on serverx, pass our creds using pypyodbc with the connect method, then 
# send our sql data retrieval command (select statement - sql query), ingest the data into a pandas DataFrame for further manipulation.

cnxn = pypyodbc.connect("Driver={SQL Server Native Client 11.0};"
                        "Server=server_name;"
                        "Database=db_name;"
                        "uid=User;pwd=password")
df = pd.read_sql_query('select * from table', cnxn)

# super simple.
